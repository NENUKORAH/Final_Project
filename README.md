# Final_Project - Data Incites
Final project for the data incites group - University of Toronto Data Analytics Bootcamp 

### Segment 1 Deliverable:

**Role - Triangle:**  Create a mockup of a machine learning model mockup and explain how it will work with the rest of the project steps.
-  A provisional machine learning model and a mockup of a machine learning model were created for deliverable 1. 


#### Machine learning model creation:
   
- We first reviewed the data on Kaggle website to assess the data characteristics.

- We will load the data into a Pandasâ€™ DataFrame for the Linear Regression model from a PostgreSQL database.

- After data preprocessing, we will train a simple linear regression model using moving average as a predictor for the closing price.

- We will analyze the accuracy of our model, plot the results, and consider the magnitude of our errors.

- We will be using python and scikit-learn to present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model.

- This model will take data from the provisional database and output labels for input data.
