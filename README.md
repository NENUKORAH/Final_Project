# Final_Project
Final project for the data incites group - University of Toronto Data Analytics Bootcamp 

# Technologies Used for Project

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will use Pandas to clean the dataset and perform an exploratory analysis.  We will also use Python to complete further analysis on our dataset.

## Database Storage
We intend to use Postgresql to store our dataset and use Flask to display the analysis results.

## Machine Learning
We will be using SciKitLearn for our ML Library to perform our Linear Regression.  This will be a supervised ML algorithm to predict a continuous and constant slope using a simple regression model.

## Dashboard
We will be using a Flask template with Javascript for an interactive dashboard and will be host on our github final project site.
