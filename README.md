# Final_Project
Final project for the data incites group - University of Toronto Data Analytics Bootcamp 

## Group : Data Incites

## Segment 1 Deliverable

**Role - Triangle:**  Create a mockup of a machine learning model mockup adn explain hw it will work with teh rest of teh project steps.


### Machine learning model creation:
   
- The first review of the data was done on Kaggle website to assess the data characteristics.

- We will load the data into a Pandasâ€™ DataFrame for the Linear Regression model from PostgreSQL.

- After data preprocessing, we will train a simple linear regression model using moving average as a predictor for the closing price.

- We will analyze the accuracy of our model, plot the results, and consider the magnitude of our errors.

- We will be using python and scikit-learn to present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model.

- This model will take data from the provisional database and output labels for input data.-
